1) final->

Note : If a class is declared as final then by default all of the methods present in that class 
are automatically final but variables are not.

2) finalize method

It is a method that the Garbage Collector always calls just before the deletion/destroying the object.
Which is just a clean up activity or we can say resource de-allocation.


3) A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs 
as well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode.


*Which one suits better depends on the application 

-Interfaces are useful because Java classes will not support multiple inheritance but interfaces do.

-Abstract classes are useful when you need concrete behavior from the base class.

4) Inheritance -> is run a time polymorphism (can be overload or override)

5) Polymorphism -> Polymorphism is the capability of a method to do different things based on the 
object that it is acting upon (method overloading and method overriding )

In HashMap, null values are allowed for key and values, whereas in 
ConcurrentHashMap null value is not allowed for key and value, otherwise 
we will get Run-time exception saying NullPointerException.
